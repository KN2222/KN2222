 Hi there 

**` Technophile (sound weird but it is actually not)  `**

### Hey there \*wave\* ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student. My professional aim is to become a Web Developer. Now I'm here to carry out my goal. My focus is constantly on taking on new difficulties and putting in all of my efforts and expertise to effectively deal with them. I'm searching for a chance to take on new challenges and help others climb the success ladder. "[][]"
